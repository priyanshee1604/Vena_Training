Java has become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world, powering everything from enterprise-level backend systems to mobile applications on Android. Its platform independence, thanks to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), allows developers to write code once and run it anywhere. Over the years, Java has evolved with regular updates that introduce powerful features like lambdas, streams, and modern concurrency APIs, making it both robust and versatile for developers across various domains.

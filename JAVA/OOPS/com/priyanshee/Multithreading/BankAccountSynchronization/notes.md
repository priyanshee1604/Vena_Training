### üîí `synchronized` ‚Äì How it works

When you use `synchronized`, Java puts a **lock (monitor)** on the object or method:

* `synchronized method`: locks on the current instance (`this`).
* `synchronized block`: locks on the specified object.

**Only one thread can hold the lock at a time**, so other threads trying to enter the synchronized area will have to wait.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Why `synchronized` can be **inefficient**

1. **Blocking all threads**:

    * Even if only one thread modifies a tiny piece of data (like a simple balance update), **other threads are blocked entirely**, even if they are only reading.
    * This reduces **concurrency** and **parallelism**, making it slower under high thread load.

2. **Coarse locking**:

    * If you put all logic inside a synchronized block (e.g., `deposit`, `withdraw`, logging), then even unrelated operations can't run in parallel.

3. **No lock flexibility**:

    * You can't do `tryLock`, or set timeouts or interrupts ‚Äî once a thread is waiting on `synchronized`, it waits indefinitely until it gets the lock.

### ‚úÖ More efficient alternatives

#### 1. **ReentrantLock**

A more flexible alternative from `java.util.concurrent.locks`.

* Allows `tryLock()`, timeouts, and better control of locking logic.
* Can separate locks per resource (e.g., one per account, or one for balance, another for log).

Example:

```java
ReentrantLock balanceLock = new ReentrantLock();

balanceLock.lock();
try {
   // safe access
} finally {
   balanceLock.unlock();
}
```

**Benefit**: Finer control, avoid unnecessary blocking.

---

#### 2. **Atomic Variables**

For simple variables like `balance`, `AtomicDouble` (via Guava or custom) allows lock-free atomic operations.

```java
AtomicLong balance = new AtomicLong(100);

balance.addAndGet(50); // atomic
```

‚úÖ Efficient and fast
‚ùå But less useful for compound operations like checking then withdrawing.

---

#### 3. **ReadWriteLock** (for read-heavy systems)

Allows multiple readers, but only one writer.

* `readLock()` lets many threads read at once.
* `writeLock()` is exclusive for writing.

Great when reads vastly outnumber writes.

### üîç Which to choose?

| Approach        | Concurrency | Flexibility | Simplicity | Use case                                    |
| --------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `synchronized`  | ‚ùå Low       | ‚ùå Low       | ‚úÖ Easy     | Small apps, low contention                  |
| `ReentrantLock` | ‚úÖ Medium    | ‚úÖ High      | ‚ùå Verbose  | Medium to high concurrency + custom control |
| `Atomic` vars   | ‚úÖ High      | ‚ùå Low       | ‚úÖ Simple   | Fast counters, balances (simple cases)      |
| `ReadWriteLock` | ‚úÖ High      | ‚úÖ Medium    | ‚ùå Verbose  | Read-heavy systems                          |

### ‚úÖ Final Verdict

* For **simple, low-thread-count apps**, `synchronized` is fine.
* For **high-performance banking or transaction apps**, prefer `ReentrantLock`, **especially with per-account locking** to avoid global bottlenecks.

❌ Problem with your current Comparator
Let’s say you try to add:

new Player("A", 90);
new Player("B", 90);
Both have the same score, so Comparator.comparing(Player::getScore) will treat them as equal → second one won’t be added!

✅ Solution: Refine the Comparator:
You need to make the comparator more robust by using name as a tiebreaker:

java
Copy
Edit
Set<Player> players = new TreeSet<>(
    Comparator.comparingInt(Player::getScore).reversed()
              .thenComparing(Player::getName)
);
Now, players with the same score are not considered equal unless their names match too.

🔍 TreeSet in Java:
Internally uses a Red-Black Tree.

Enforces:

Sorted Order

Uniqueness

But unlike HashSet which uses equals() and hashCode(), the TreeSet relies on the compareTo() or Comparator result.

📌 So, in a TreeSet<Player>:
java
Copy
Edit
TreeSet<Player> players = new TreeSet<>(Comparator.comparing(Player::getScore).reversed());
Sorting: by score (descending)

Uniqueness: also based only on score
→ So two players with the same score will be treated as duplicates, even if their names are different.

🧠 Comparator = Defines "Key" in TreeSet
In a TreeMap/TreeSet, the comparator acts like a key extractor:

If Comparator.compare(a, b) == 0, the TreeSet thinks a and b are equal.

So only one of them is stored.

---------------------------------------------------
Excellent — let’s clear this up once and for all. We’ll compare **when and why `equals()` & `hashCode()` are needed**, versus **when a `Comparator` is enough** — using your `TreeSet<Player>` leaderboard example.

---

## ✅ 1. `equals()` and `hashCode()` — WHEN and WHY?

These two methods are **used by Hash-based collections**:

* `HashSet`
* `HashMap`
* `Hashtable`
* `ConcurrentHashMap`

### 🔑 Purpose:

* **`equals()`** → defines **logical equality** (Are these two objects the same based on content?)
* **`hashCode()`** → determines the **bucket** (group) in a hash table where the object is stored

### ✅ You MUST override both if:

* You use the object in a `HashSet` or as a `Map` key
* You want to define your own **"meaning of equality"** (e.g., Players are equal if they have the same name)

```java
@Override
public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (this == o) return true;
    if (!(o instanceof Player)) return false;
    Player player = (Player) o;
    return Objects.equals(name, player.name);
}

@Override
public int hashCode() {
    return Objects.hash(name);
}
```

---

## ✅ 2. `Comparator` or `Comparable` — WHEN and WHY?

These are used in **sorted collections**:

* `TreeSet`
* `TreeMap`
* `PriorityQueue`
* `Arrays.sort()`, `Collections.sort()`

### 🔑 Purpose:

* Define **ordering**
* **AND** define **equality** in the context of the sorted structure
  (If `compare(a, b) == 0`, they are considered duplicates in `TreeSet`/`TreeMap`)

### ✅ You MUST provide a `Comparator` (or make the class `Comparable`) if:

* You want to **sort** your objects
* You want to define **custom logic** for how duplicates are detected in `TreeSet`/`TreeMap`

## ⚠️ Key Difference in TreeSet

In your `TreeSet<Player>`:

```java
TreeSet<Player> players = new TreeSet<>(
    Comparator.comparing(Player::getScore).reversed()
);
```

### Problem:

* If two players have same score:

  * `compare(a, b) == 0`
  * → Only one is stored

### Fix:

```java
TreeSet<Player> players = new TreeSet<>(
    Comparator.comparing(Player::getScore).reversed()
              .thenComparing(Player::getName)
);
```

Now two players with same score but different names will **both be allowed**, because comparator doesn’t say they’re equal anymore.

---

## 🧠 Should You Override `equals()` and `hashCode()` Too?

Yes, if:

* You want to use `.contains()`, `.remove()`, or store in `HashSet`/`HashMap`
* You want consistency across all collections
* You ever want to compare `Player` objects logically

## 🎯 Final Verdict for Your `Leaderboard` Code

| Use Case                           | Comparator Needed? | equals/hashCode Needed?    | Why?                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `TreeSet<Player>`                  | ✅ Yes              | Optional, but good to have | Comparator handles uniqueness + order  |
| `HashSet<Player>`                  | ❌ No               | ✅ Yes                      | For correct hashing + equality         |
| Searching in list by name          | ❌ No               | Optional                   | You're manually comparing `.getName()` |
| Using `.contains(new Player(...))` | ❌ No               | ✅ Yes                      | Relies on `equals()` for comparison    |
